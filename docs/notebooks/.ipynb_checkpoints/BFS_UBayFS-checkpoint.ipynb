    "# Block feature selection with UBayFS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Block feature selection is essential in different fields of application, including treatment outcome prediction in healthcare (for diseases such as cancer). Commonly, data is available from multiple sources, including clinical, genetic, and image data, where measurements from a common source are aggregated into a feature block. In many cases, however, not all data sources are relevant for machine learning models: Suppose we suspected that image data would not contain additional information to the other feature blocks. In that case, it might be easier, in terms of data acquisition and availability, to favor models that do not depend on all data sources at once. In order to detect that a single feature block does not provide any additional information, block feature selection can be deployed. UBayFS is able to cover this scenario by specifying constraints on a block level.\n",
